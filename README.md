## 📖 Overview

React-Native-Boilerplate is a comprehensive starter kit designed to jumpstart your React Native mobile app development.  
It offers a well-structured architecture with pre-configured tools, components, and ready-to-use integrations — letting developers focus on building features rather than setup.

### Why React-Native-Boilerplate?

This project provides a solid foundation for scalable, maintainable React Native applications.  

**Core Features include:**
- ✅ **Standardized Configuration**: Pre-built setup for Metro, Jest, and app metadata ensures a consistent environment.  
- 🧩 **Reusable UI Components**: Customizable buttons, cards, spinners, and overlays for accelerated development.  
- 🌐 **Internationalization (i18n)**: Built-in support for multiple languages.  
- 🧭 **Seamless Navigation**: Custom drawer and tab navigation with intuitive UX.  
- 🔒 **Secure Native Modules**: Integrated device information helpers, keychain management, and modern utilities.  
- 📱 **Cross-Platform Ready**: Configured for Android and iOS with native setup and build scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Programming Language**: TypeScript  
- **Package Managers**: NPM, Bundler, Gradle  
- **Container Runtime**: Podman  

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YourRepo/React-Native-Boilerplate.git

# Navigate to the project
cd React-Native-Boilerplate

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
bundle install       # only first time
bundle exec pod install
cd ..
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Step 1: Start Metro

Metro is the JavaScript bundler for React Native. Run it with:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Build and Run the App

Open a new terminal and run:

#### Android
```bash
npm run android
# OR
yarn android
```

#### iOS
```bash
npm run ios
# OR
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the app running in your simulator or device.  
You can also run it directly from **Android Studio** or **Xcode**.

### Step 3: Modify the App

Open `App.tsx` and make changes. With [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh), updates will apply instantly.  

- **Android**: Press `R` twice or open Dev Menu (`Ctrl+M` or `Cmd+M`).  
- **iOS**: Press `R` in iOS Simulator.

## 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run end-to-end tests (if configured):

```bash
npm run e2e
```
